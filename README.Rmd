**pmlbr** is an R interface to the [Penn Machine Learning Benchmarks](https://epistasislab.github.io/pmlb/) (PMLB) data repository, a large collection of curated benchmark datasets for evaluating and comparing supervised machine learning algorithms.
These datasets cover a broad range of applications including binary/multi-class classification and regression problems as well as combinations of categorical, ordinal, and continuous features.

This repository is originally forked from [makeyourownmaker/pmlblite](https://github.com/makeyourownmaker/pmlblite).
We thank the **pmlblite**'s author for releasing the source code under the [GPL-2 license](https://github.com/makeyourownmaker/pmlblite/blob/be763f7011b21e71e3eaf6d3ca6b794d405507cd/LICENSE) so that others could reuse the software.

## Install

This package works for any recent version of R.

You can install the released version of **pmlbr** from CRAN with:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("pmlbr")
```

Or the development version from GitHub with remotes:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages('remotes') # uncomment to install remotes
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("EpistasisLab/pmlbr")
```

## Usage

The core function of this package is `fetch_data` that allows us to download data from the PMLB repository.
For example:
``` {r}
library(pmlbr)

# Download features and labels for penguins dataset in single data frame
penguins <- fetch_data("penguins")
str(penguins)

# Download features and labels for penguins dataset in separate data structures
penguins <- fetch_data("penguins", return_X_y = TRUE)
head(penguins$x) # data frame
head(penguins$y) # vector
```

Let's check other available datasets and their summary statistics:

``` {r}
# Dataset names
sample(classification_datasets(), 9)
sample(regression_datasets(), 9)

# Dataset summaries
sum_stats <- summary_stats()
head(sum_stats)
```

Selecting a subset of datasets that satisfy certain conditions is straight forward with `dplyr`.
For example, if we need datasets with fewer than 100 observations for a classification task: 
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
sum_stats %>%
  filter(n_instances < 100, task == "classification") %>%
  pull(dataset)
```


### Dataset format

All data sets are stored in a common format:

* First row is the column names
* Each following row corresponds to an individual observation
* The target column is named `target`
* All columns are tab (`\t`) separated
* All files are compressed with `gzip` to conserve space

This R library includes summaries of the classification and regression data sets but does **not**
store any of the PMLB data sets.  The data sets can be downloaded using the `fetch_data` function which
is similar to the corresponding PMLB python function.  

Further info:
``` {r}
?fetch_data
?summary_stats
```
